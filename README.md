# ChinaRobotPathFollower

## What is this?
This is the repository for FRC team 1595's robot (China Robot). This meerly exists to test out the path following tool, so that we can later apply something similar to our officail robot.

## Cool. So it works?
**No.** 

While teleop works, the current autonomous has a bug in which it drives at max speed. Forever.

*Or atleast until the autonomous peroid ends.*

We're just trying to make it drive forward 1 meter away from its starting point.

There is also another bug where the library that we use cannot find certain files, so crashes the entire program. Its fun stuff. 



If anyone knows of a solution (other than switching to C++ or python becasue well... no) feel free to submit a pull request!
